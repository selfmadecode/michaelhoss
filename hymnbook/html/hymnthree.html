                    <li>Father, let me dedicate <br>
                        All this years to Thee <br>
                        In whatever wordly state <br>
                        Thou wilt have me be: <br>
                        Not from sorrow, pain, or care, <br>
                        Freedom dare I claim; <br>
                        This alone shall be my prayer' <br>
                        "Glorify Thy Name." <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can a child presume to choose <br>
                        Where or how to live? <br>
                        Can a father's love refuse <br>
                        All the best to give? <br>
                        More Thou givest every day <br>
                        Than the best can claim, <br>
                        Nor with boldest aught that may <br>
                        "Glorify Thy Name." <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If in mercy Thou wilt spare <br>
                        Joys that yet are mine; <br>
                        If on life, serene and fair, <br>
                        Brighter rays may shine; <br>
                        Let my glad heart, while it sings, <br>
                        Thee in all proclaim, <br>
                        And, whate'er the future brings, <br>
                        "Glorify Thy Name" <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If Thou callest to the cross <br>
                        And its shadows come, <br>
                        Turning all my gain to loss, <br>
                        Shrouding heart and home; <br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
