                        A few more seasons come, <br>
                        And we shall be with those that rest <br>
                        Asleep within the tomb <br>
                        Then, O my Lord, prepare <br>
                        My soul for that Great Day <br>
                        O wash me in Thy precious <br>
                        Blood, And take my sins away.<br>

                    <li>
                        Shepherd of Thy blood-bought sheep, <br>
                        Teach ths stony hearts to weep, <br>
                        let the blind have eyes to see, <br>
                        See themeselves, and look to Thee. <br>

                    <li>
                        Where Thou hast Thy work begun, <br>
                        Give new strength the race to run; <br>
                        Scatter darkness, doubts and fears; <br>
                        Wipe away the mourner's tears. <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bless us all, both old and young; <br>
                        Call forth praise from every tongue; <br>
                        let this whole assembly prove <br>
                        All thy power and all Thy love. Amen. <br>
