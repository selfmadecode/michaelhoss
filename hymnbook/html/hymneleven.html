                    <li>And now, my soul, another year <br>
                        Of thy short life is past; <br>
                        I cannot long continue here, <br>
                        And this may be my last. <br>

                    <li>
                        Much of my dubious life is gone, <br>
                        Nor will return again; <br>
                        And swift my passing moments run, <br>
                        The few that still remain <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Awake, my soul; with utmost care <br>
                        Thy tru condition learn; <br>
                        What are thy hopes, how sure, how fair? <br>
                        And what thy chief concern?<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now a new scene of times begins <br>
                        Set out afresh for Heaven; <br>
                        Seek pardon for thy former sins <br>
                        In Christ's so freely given <br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
