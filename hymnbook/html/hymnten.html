                    <li>From glory unto glory! <br>
                        Be this our joyous song <br>
                        As on the King's own highway <br>
                        We bravely march along! <br>
                        From glory unto glory! <br>
                        O word of stirring cheer, <br>
                        As dawn the solemn brightness <br>
                        Of another glad New Year <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>From glory unto glory! <br>
                        What great things He hath done, <br>
                        What wonders He hath shown us, <br>
                        What triumphs He hath won! <br>
                        From glory unto glory! <br>
                        What mighty blessings crown <br>
                        The lives for which our lord <br>
                        Hath laid His own so freely down <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In our weakness and distress, <br>
                        Reck of strenght, be Thou our stay; <br>
                        In the pathless wilderness <br>
                        Be our true and living way.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Who of us death's awful road <br>
                        In the coming year shall tread<br>
                        wish Thy road and staff, O God <br>
                        Comfort Thou his dying bed. <br>
