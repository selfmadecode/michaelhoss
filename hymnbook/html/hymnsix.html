                    <li>O God, our Help in ages past, <br>
                        Our Hope for years to come <br>
                        Our Shelter from the stormy blast, <br>
                        And our Eternal Home; <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Beneath the shadow of Thy Throne <br>
                        Thy Saints have dwelt secure; <br>
                        Suffcient is Thine Arm alone; <br>
                        And our defence is sure, <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Before the hills in order stood, <br>
                        Or Earth received her frame, <br>
                        From everlasting Thou art God; <br>
                        To endless years the Same.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Thousand ages in thy sight <br>
                        Are like evening gone.<br>
                        Short ass the watch that ends the night <br>
                        Before the rising sun. <br>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Time, like an ever-rolling stream, <br>
                        Bears all its son away;<br>
                        They fly forgotten, as a dream <br>
                        Dies at the opening day <br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
